# AI-Battleship
AI battleship was a final project for a C# programming class. 

The goal of the project was to make an AI that utilized a given interface to communicate with the central control program for a modified Battleship game that could be played with any number of players. By the end of the project, my team and I had successfully created an AI that won the majority of its matches when run. 

Examples of the running program can be seen in GreenGroup_Module8_GroupAssignment_Screenshots.docx.
